## ITMD 362, Production Problem 04: Implementing HCI guidelines for Touchscreens

## The Problem

Using the HCI guidelines from either iOS or Android, sketch a new small-screen touch-friendly design
for the membership/join page for Chicagoâ€™s Museum of Contemporary Art at
https://experience.mcachicago.org/donate/contribute1?ct=6 (Hint: visit the URL on your phone).

**You only need to sketch your redesign**, and in the text below, reference at least three different
points of guidance from chosen HCI guidelines that went into your redesign sketches (you might
want to do multiple sketches, each highlighting a different feature of the same overall design).

## Resources

* Apple iOS HCI Guidlines:
  https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/
* Android Guidelines:
  https://developer.android.com/design

## Deliverables

Small commits to your Production Problems repository that include:

1. photographs of sketches of your new design, from your sketchbook
2. an explanation of three different points of guidance from your chosen guidelines (point to the
   specific URL where the guidance can be found) that you implemented in your sketch, written below:

* HCI Guideline One (URL):https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/bars/navigation-bars/
* Describe how you implemented that guideline in your sketch: The first thing that threw me off when looking at the page was the navigation bar at the top
as it is awkwardly squished in between the header and the title. The guideline from apple suggests that navigation bar should be placed at the top below the
status bar. So, I removed the header MCA title at the top as it is unnecessary, you already know what website you are in, and replaced it with the navigation
links. I also left the Log-in and car links at the right as they serve as a sort of "control" navigation, I also put in a cart icon to make it easier to understand.

* HCI Guideline Two (URL):https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/visual-design/typography/
* Describe how you implemented that guideline in your sketch: The next thing that threw me off was the typography of the website. It does look a bit nice and
fancy but that should not get in the way of legibility. My handwriting is pretty bad but what I tried to focus on was having one consistent typeface and changing
the typeface for more legibility. I also focused on changing font weight to focus on importance, specifically changing the title to be more bold to place the importance
of the page.

* HCI Guideline Three (URL):https://material.io/design/layout/responsive-layout-grid.html#ui-regions
* Describe how you implemented that guideline in your sketch: Finally, I wanted to create well defined margins in my sketch as the website's margins do not leave enough
breathing space for the content in it. I decided to give wider margins for said content but not too wide as to suffocate said content and make the page bigger than it
should be. In all, I changed the layout of the page to better fit mobile web view.
