1. A monochromatic color palette for a site introducing a new console gaming platform

Your Palette URL:http://paletton.com/#uid=13Z0u0kHOGUm3JTsiI7IirYKdlN
Your Rationale: The reason that I chose this palette is due to the reason that a lot of gaming platforms usually come out with consoles using colors that really pop out at you. A lot of them give you options on what style you want your console to be but a gaming platform usually has a color them, like Xbox with its white and black/green theme and Sony with their different shades of blue for the PS4. Even different desktops utilize RGB setups with high saturation. That is why I wanted to choose a color that is high in saturation.

2. An adjacent color palette for announcing springtime tours at the Chicago Botanical Gardens

Your Palette URL:http://paletton.com/#uid=52l0u0kHPFbmjJzsDHZItrEKyly
Your Rationale: When someone thinks of spring, they would usually think of blooming plants, sunny skies, and green pastures. With this color palette, there is a theme of green and yellow and I wanted to use this as a sort of symbolization of spring.  

3. A triadic color palette for styling the login page for an app for kids to learn the alphabet

Your Palette URL:http://paletton.com/#uid=3230N0kHPFbmjJzsDHZItrEKyly
Your Rationale: Children are usually attracted to bright and saturated colors when choosing between them, while adults usually stick to more muted colors. This is why I decided to go with this color palette as it utilizes the three primary bright colors of red, yellow, and blue.

4. A custom color palette for advertising a course on cybersecurity

Your Palette URL:http://paletton.com/#uid=c3U3H3O3J0koSC7fBGobinxC+xkNcqt
Your Rationale: When I try to associate technology with a color the color that I usually think of is blue. So when I thought of a color palette representing cybersecurity, I thought why not make this color palette different shades of muted blue? So that is what I did and this is why my custom color palette is like this.
