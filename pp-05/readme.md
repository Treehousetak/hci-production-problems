## ITMD 362, Production Problem 05: Usability Checklists

Usability checklists are typical, and sometimes mindless, tools/magic tricks used to find usability
problems in web and other digital projects. What you are going to do for this Production Problem is
to locate at least 2 different usability checklists of at least 25 items (use Google, but challenge
yourself to go beyond the first page of results). From those lists, create your own, condensed list
of exactly ten items **that are relevant to your group’s interface from Project Two**. Share with
your group for Project 3 to help yourselves create your own master usability checklist.

## Deliverables

* URLs for the usability checklists you’ve found:

1.https://teamsuccess.io/UX
2.https://drpete.co/?topic=25-point-website-usability-checklist

* Your own condensed ten-item, must-have usability checklist:

1. Condensed loading times. Having fast load times is always welcome and makes sure that users that visit your websites do not die of boredom while waiting for the website to load.
2. Font Size/Spacing and proper padding. Make sure that text is readable and easy to look at. If the users are straining their eyes to read your content then there is probably a
problem with the font.
3. Navigation is easy and identifiable. You don't want users to be lost while navigating your site so making sure that the navigation links are easy to find/understand is a must.
4. Styles and colors are identifiable and have a theme. You want your site to have a theme and a proper color palette and you definitely don't want random colors that strain
the eyes. Make it look snappy or professional.
5. Content is view-able in mobile/Site is responsive. In today's age, mobile devices are more common than PCs and so making sure that your website is view able and usable in mobile is a big must.
6. Important content is easy to view and given prominent placement. Having the main content easy to find and see is recommended, you don't want users to be annoyed by having to
have a scavenger hunt to find the content they visited the website in the first place.
7. Images have meaning. Use images when appropriate and don't images in places they don't belong. Having extra images slows down the load times and takes up space.
8. Common language. Language is easy to understand.
9. Consistency. Each page is consistent in theme and style.
10. White-space. Pages are not cluttered and there is enough white space to give eyes time to rest.
